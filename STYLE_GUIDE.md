# BARK Style Guide

This page contains style decisions that both developers and users of BARK
should follow to increase the readability of their code, reduce the
number of errors, and promote consistency.

## Python
We refer to the google python [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
However, instead of a 4 spaces indent, we recommend using a 2 spaces indent.

## CPP
We refer to the google c++ [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
